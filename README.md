# Repository for Data structures and algorithms at Adelaide University

Course completed in 2022 sem2,
All of the material in this repository is public, but is not to be copied and instead is to be regarded when learning concepts. Failure to comply can breach academic integrity guidelines and the author, Gerald, is not liable to any damages incurred as a result of a breach of the guidelines.

Regardless, I hope that you enjoy this course, as it was relatively fun for me.
